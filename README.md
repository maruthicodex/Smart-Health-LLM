## Smart Health LLM 

**Smart Health** is designed as a modular, scalable, and interactive AI health assistant. It integrates **deep learning**, **large language models (LLMs)**, **vector similarity search**, and **modern web technologies** to provide both **image-based** and **text-based** health assessments. The system follows a **multi-agent architecture** to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and high performance.

### 1. System Architecture Overview

The system can be broadly divided into **three layers**:

1. **Frontend Layer**

   * Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, creating a responsive and modern user interface.
   * Supports **image uploads**, **real-time chat**, and **interactive displays** like confidence bars and animated orbs.
   * Handles client-side validations, file preview, and dynamic updates for user interactions without page reloads.
   * Communicates with the backend using **HTTP POST requests** for image analysis and chat inputs.

2. **Backend Layer**

   * Developed using **Python** with frameworks like **FastAPI** for asynchronous, high-performance APIs.
   * Orchestrates the **multi-agent system**, routing requests to the appropriate agent (image, symptom, chat, or verification).
   * Handles **file uploads, preprocessing, model inference**, and response formatting.
   * Manages **chat history** and session state to ensure context-aware conversations.
   * Returns structured data to the frontend for rendering dynamic visualizations and chat responses.

3. **AI & ML Layer**

   * **Image Classification Module:**

     * Utilizes a **deep learning CNN (e.g., EfficientNet)** for classifying skin diseases.
     * Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model accuracy.
     * Provides **predictions with confidence scores**, which are rendered in the frontend.

   * **Symptom Analysis Module:**

     * Uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to understand and process natural language inputs.
     * Incorporates **FAISS-based vector similarity search** to match extracted symptoms against structured disease data.
     * Returns **top-k possible diseases** with relevant details like overview, causes, treatment, and preventive tips.

   * **Verification & Recommendation Module:**

     * Optionally cross-checks predictions against external datasets or trusted medical sources.
     * Generates **personalized recommendations** and next steps for the user.

### 2. Multi-Agent System Design

The system follows a **multi-agent approach** to separate responsibilities, improve scalability, and reduce coupling:

* **Image Classification Agent:** Handles image uploads, preprocessing, and deep learning inference.
* **Symptom Analysis Agent:** Manages natural language symptom input, LLM reasoning, and vector similarity matching.
* **Chat & Interaction Agent:** Maintains the chat interface, conversation context, and real-time updates.
* **Verification & Recommendation Agent:** Validates predictions and provides actionable guidance.

**Benefits:**

* Parallel processing allows multiple agents to work simultaneously.
* Each agent is modular, making it easy to maintain and extend.
* Specialized agents increase accuracy and reliability for both image-based and text-based predictions.

### 3. Data Flow & Communication

1. **Image Flow:**

   * User uploads an image → Frontend sends it to backend → Image Classification Agent preprocesses it → Model predicts disease → Backend sends response → Frontend displays prediction with confidence bar.

2. **Symptom Flow:**

   * User types symptoms → Frontend sends input → Symptom Analysis Agent processes via LLM → Symptoms converted to embeddings → FAISS matches similar diseases → Backend formats top results → Frontend shows structured chat response.

3. **Chat Flow:**

   * Chat & Interaction Agent updates conversation in real-time.
   * Maintains context for follow-up questions.
   * Verification agent optionally validates predictions before sending back to user.

### 4. Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn
* **AI/ML:** TensorFlow/PyTorch for CNN, HuggingFace LLM for text, FAISS for vector similarity
* **Utilities:** PIL for image preprocessing, NumPy/Pandas for data handling
* **Deployment:** Can be containerized using Docker for portability and scalability

### 5. Key Advantages

* **Dual-Module Health Assessment:** Supports both image-based and symptom-based analysis.
* **Interactive User Experience:** Modern UI with responsive design, animations, and real-time chat.
* **High Scalability:** Modular multi-agent design allows addition of new agents without affecting existing functionality.
* **Accuracy & Reliability:** Combines deep learning, LLM reasoning, and vector similarity search for robust predictions.
* **Future Extensibility:** New features like lifestyle advice, drug recommendations, or telemedicine integration can be added seamlessly.

 CUDA Acceleration – Enabled GPU usage for faster model inference and reduced latency in skin disease prediction

 Efficient Embeddings – Used all-MiniLM to generate lightweight yet accurate embeddings for semantic search

<br/>

## Lessons Learned

Building SmartHealth-LLM gave me hands-on experience in combining deep learning and LLM-based reasoning for real-world healthcare use cases. Some key lessons and challenges:

* **RAG & Retrieval Design:**
  Learned how to build a symptom-based semantic search system using FAISS and MiniLM, and integrate it with a language model for accurate, context-aware responses.

* **Model Integration & Performance:**
  Faced challenges integrating image-based CNN models (EfficientNet-B0) with real-time web applications. Solved it using model caching and optimizing inference with CUDA.

* **LLM Prompt Tuning:**
  Realized the importance of prompt clarity and context when working with LLMs to ensure medical suggestions were structured, useful, and safe.

* **Handling Noisy Medical Data:**
  Built text cleaning and NER filters to extract relevant keywords and symptoms from unstructured input.

* **Frontend-Backend Sync:**
  Gained experience managing interactions between a Streamlit frontend and a FastAPI backend — handling JSON inputs, form validation, and async inference calls.

* **Trade-offs in Real-Time AI Apps:**
  Learned to balance model accuracy with responsiveness and resource usage, especially in a setup where both image and text processing are involved.

## FAQ

#### How does SmartHealth predict skin diseases?

 It uses a pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 deep learning model to classify uploaded skin images.

#### What happens when I enter my symptoms?

The system uses semantic search (FAISS + MiniLM) to find relevant diseases and then uses an LLM to generate detailed responses.

####  Is my data stored?

Currently, the app does not store any user data. All predictions happen in-memory for privacy.

#### Can I use this without a GPU?

Yes, but the training will be slower. CUDA acceleration is used only if available.
